# Christina Marcial's Plushie Shop React App

I have made a mock store website front where visitors can view plushies, their information such as price/description, and add them to their cart.

Visitors can view how much plushies are in their cart, what price each type costs, and the total price of all of the plushies.

Since this is not a real store, checking out simply refreshes the page.

Visitors are given instructions to all of this information so they know what to do with the site.

React components include buttons, alerts, tool tips, counters, and reloading the page.

View the store: https://teldrynsero.github.io/my-app/
